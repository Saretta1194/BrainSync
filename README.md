## üß† Introduction

**BrainSync** is a fun and engaging quiz program designed to challenge users across 3 levels of difficulty: Easy, Medium, and Hard. It uses a Google Sheet to retrieve and store questions and user scores. The game is designed to run in a terminal environment and provides instant feedback, score tracking, and end-of-game summaries.

## üéØ Project Goals

- Provide a simple but engaging educational quiz game.
- Introduce users to progressively challenging content.
- Encourage learning through fun and competition.
- Log all user performance data for future insights.

---

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è User Goals

- Understand the game rules clearly.
- Play through multiple quiz levels with increasing difficulty.
- Get instant feedback on answers.
- Receive a final performance summary.
- Ensure progress is saved securely.

---
## üíº Site Owner Goals

- Present an interactive educational tool.
- Collect user performance data via Google Sheets.
- Provide an intuitive, bug-free experience.
- Keep the code modular and scalable for future improvements.

---
## üìù Pre-Development Planning

- Brainstormed quiz mechanics and win/loss conditions.
Wireframes <img src="assets/images/logic.png" alt="Wireframes of the game" width="800">
- Created question templates for Google Sheets.
- Planned function responsibilities (e.g., user input, score tracking, game flow).
- Outlined a clear UI in terminal format with visual ASCII art and emojis for feedback.

---
## üíª Development

- Used Python and `gspread` to connect with Google Sheets.
- Structured code for clear function segregation.
- Added terminal UI elements: title screen, menu, rules, and real-time prompts.
- Enabled score persistence using Google Sheets append functionality.

## Testing

The portal has undergone extensive testing, and the results are available for review
[here - TESTING](https://github.com/Saretta1194/BrainSync/blob/main/TESTING.md)

### Validator

- CI Python Linter
  - No errors were returned when passing the final version through the Python Linter with the code # noqa: W291  [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com)

<img src="assets/images/python test.jpg" alt="CI Python Linter" width="800">
 
 - Without this code the Python Linter returned error W291 inside the ASCII Logo

## Deployment
- The deployment was done through heroku. following the steps below:
  - Preparing for deployment:
      - Add a new line character ("\n") at the end of each input request.
      - Create a list of dependancies to go into the requirements.txt file by typing "pip3 freeze > requirements.txt" into the terminal.
  - Deployment:
      - Log into Heroku and in the dashboard, press the "Create new app" button.
      - Click on the "Settings" tab, scroll down to the "Reveal Config Vars" button and click on it to create config vars.
      - Add the first config vars. The key is "CREDS" and value is the contents of the creds.json file.
      - Add the second config vars. The key is "PORT" and value is "8000".
      - Click on the "Add buildpack" button on the same page and add the buildpacks "python" and "node.js" in this order.
      - Click on the "Deploy" tab.
      - Choose the "GitHub" deployment method and then connect to GitHub.
      - Scroll down to the "Manual deploys" section, select the "main" branch to deploy from and then press the "Deploy branch" button to deploy the project.

## Bugs
I encountered a bug where the Python Linter flagged a W291 error caused by trailing whitespace in the ASCII logo section of the code. Since the spacing was intentional to preserve the visual formatting of the logo, this warning was not relevant to the functionality of the program. To resolve the issue, I used the # noqa: W291 comment to suppress the linter warning on those specific lines.
